## Overview

### The challenge

Through this challenge, I practiced:
- creating a custom cursor on hover, adding animation depending on the mouseevent
- creating a draggable slider from scratch without using libraries
- last but not least, building a react project with styled components!

From the analysis to the deployment of the project, it took me approximately 25 hours, over the period of 8 days (around 3 hours of work per day)
- analysis, creating key components such as slider, custom cursor, loader, etc : 8h
- header, main (sections), footer: 12h
- dark theme, debugging, deployment: 5h
